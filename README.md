# Alignment Viewer 2.0

Alignment Viewer 2.0 is a standalone multiple [multiple sequence alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment) (MSA) viewer written in TypeScript. This project uses the React framework and was boostrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A demo is available on Github Pages: https://sanderlab.github.io/AlignmentViewer2.0/

The Alignment Viewer 2.0 component ffeatures:

- Display alignment details (i.e., down to individual residues) and/or the alignment in its entirety.
- Support for DNA/RNA and protein sequences
- Calculates and displays [sequence logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_logo), consensus sequence, conservation / gap statistics.
- Support for sorting the alignment
- Support for different styling options including color schemes and selection of which residues to color (e.g., only those that match the consensus sequences).
- Client side only - runs in the browser alone.
- View can be customized, removing or adding only the pieces needed.
- Support for interaction events (clicking on, mousing over the alignments, logos, etc)

## Embedding Alignment Viewer 2.0

We're on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) ([repository link](https://https://www.npmjs.com/package/alignment-viewer-2/)) so you can install using your favorite package manager, e.g.,:

```sh
yarn add alignment-viewer-2
```

Once installed, adding to your website is as simple as:

```JSX
import * as React from 'react';
import { AlignmentViewer, FastaAlignment } from "alignment-viewer-2";

const fastaFileText = ">target\n" +
                      "ATGCATGC\n" +
                      ">seq1\n" +
                      "AAAACCCC\n" +
                      ">seq2\n" +
                      "ATGCATTT\n" +
                      ">seq3\n" +
                      "ATGCAAAA\n"
const alignmentObj = FastaAlignment.fromFileContents(
    "ALIGNMENT_NAME", fastaFileText
);

<AlignmentViewer alignment={ alignmentObj } style={ alignmentObj.getDefaultStyle() } />
```

## Performance Strategy

The Alignment Viewer 2.0 component was designed from the ground up to be highly performant in order to allow for viewing and analysis of very large MSAs - we actively test on an alignment based on [beta-lactamase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase) that contains ~23,000
sequences of length ~250 amino acids ([link to beta-lactamase MSA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanderlab/AlignmentViewer2.0/master/public/7fa1c5691376beab198788a726917d48_b0.4.a2m)).

Our strategy for dealing with peformance issues boils down to two main approaches:

1. **Don't load what isn't visible ([Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/))**: Inserting many elements into the HTML DOM at one time absolutely kills performance. For example, insertion of roughly 100,000 elements (think an alignment of 1000 sequences of length 100) can drastically decreease performance. In order to allow for larger alignments in the _Detailed MSA Viewer_, we only insert the portion of the MSA that is visible at any given time. Smart loading decreases the number of elements in the DOM significantly and drastically improves performance. To accomplish this, we make use of the [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/) project, and use a custom mode / highlighter to parse and style multiple sequence alignments.

2. **Use the graphics card ([WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) with [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/))**: In order to view the entire MSA in the same viewed windoow, we have also implemented the _MiniMap MSA Viewer_ using the [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/) 2D WebGL framework. This viewer avoids having many DOM elements by representing the MSA as a series of tiled images (avoiding browser image size limits) which can be zoomed, scaled, interacted with, etc. using the [pixi-viewport](https://github.com/davidfig/pixi-viewport) project.

## Other Web-based Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewers

- Alignment Viewer<sup>1</sup> ([webpage](https://alignmentviewer.org/), [github](https://github.com/sanderlab/alignmentviewer)): The predecessor to Alignment Viewer 2.0, this project and website provide a means to view MSAs as perform additional sequence analysis like viewing sequence space with a UMAP component. Alignment Viewer was written in javascript.
- MSAViewer<sup>2</sup> ([webpage](http://msa.biojs.net), [github](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa)): A popular MSA viewer that provides a bunch of functionality such as sorting, filtering, changing color schemes, etc. MSAViewer can also be easily imported and embedded into other projects. Alignment Viewer was written in javascript.
- Jalview<sup>3</sup> ([webpage](https://www.jalview.org/)): an MSA viewer that provides primary, secondary, and tertiary visualizations and analyses that include sequence alignment, conservation and clustering, secondary structure and disorder prediction, etc.
- MView <sup>4</sup> ([webpage](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mview/)): Although not built specifically for the web, the MView command line utility can be executed from an EBI tool service. This tool can be used to reformats multiple sequence alignments files into html markup.
- Wasabi<sup>5</sup> ([webpage](http://wasabiapp.org/), [github](https://github.com/veidenberg/wasabi)): In addition to providing an MSA viewer, the Wasabi project provides a bunch of tools for evolutionary sequence analysis. Wasabi was written in python and javascript.
- AliView<sup>6</sup> ([webpage](https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/), [github](https://github.com/AliView/AliView)): Although aliview isn't web-based, it is one of the fastest and most useful MSA viewers so I thought it important to include.

## Color Schemes

Alignment Viewer 2.0 provides a bunch of different color schemes for both amino acid and nucleotide sequences. Scheme definitions were taken from the [msa-colorschemes](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa-colorschemes) repository, a part of the
[MSAViewer project](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa)<sup>2</sup>, which derived many of the schemes from [JalView](https://www.jalview.org/help/html/colourSchemes/)<sup>3</sup>.
